      I am a Teaching Fellow at The University of Chicago. 
      I teach core undergraduate courses for College students and majors in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Psychology, and Computer Science, 
      including newly designed methods courses that integrate experimental and computational approaches.

      I specialize in language understanding in humans and machines, experimental design, web-based behavioral and reading studies, 
      data analysis (R), and NLP tools (Python).
      The overarching goal of my research is to understand the cognitive mechanisms involved in human language processing 
      within discourse context. To achieve this, I employ a dual approach. On the one hand, I conduct behavioral experiments 
      to explore discourse comprehension through cross-linguistic and cross-populational studies. On the other, I leverage 
      computational methods in Natural Language Processing to gain insights into human language processing, as well as 
      develop and test hypotheses about cognitive models.
