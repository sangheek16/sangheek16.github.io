  I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the University of Chicago.
  I'm a <a href="https://www.franke.uchicago.edu/franke-fellows" target="_blank">Franke Institute Doctoral Residential Fellow</a> in AY 2023-24.
  I will be in Paris in Spring 2024 to work with Laboratoire dâ€™Excellence Empirical Foundations of Linguistics (Labex EFL)
  for a <a href="https://en.labex-efl.fr/axe-2" target="_blank">collaborative project on crosslinguistic exploration of relative clauses</a>
  (funded by the French National Research Agency, ANR-10-LABX-0083).

  The overarching goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying human sentence/discourse comprehension in conversational settings.
  To do so, I take a dual approach. On the one hand, I conduct behavioral experiments to understand discourse comprehension in humans through 
  cross-linguistic and cross-populational investigations. On the other, I use computational methods in Natural Language Processing
  to gain insights about human language processing and build and test hypotheses about cognitive models.
