  I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the University of Chicago.
  I'm a <a href="https://www.franke.uchicago.edu/franke-fellows" target="_blank">Franke Institute Doctoral Residential Fellow</a> in AY 2023-24.
  I will be in Paris in Spring 2024 for a research project with Laboratoire dâ€™Excellence Empirical Foundations of Linguistics (LabEx EFL) at 
  Le Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle (LLF).

  The overarching goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying human language processing in discourse context.
  To do so, I take a dual approach. On the one hand, I conduct behavioral experiments to understand discourse comprehension in humans through 
  cross-linguistic and cross-populational investigations. On the other, I use computational methods in Natural Language Processing
  to gain insights about human language processing and build and test hypotheses about cognitive models.
