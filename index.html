    I am a Researcher and Teaching Fellow at the University of Chicago. 
    I specialize in language understanding in humans and machines, 
    web-based behavioral, reading, and eye-tracking studies, experimental design, data analysis (R), and NLP tools (Python).
    I teach core undergraduate courses for College students and majors in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Psychology, and Computer Science, 
    including newly designed methods courses that integrate experimental and computational approaches.

    The overarching goal of my research is to understand the cognitive mechanisms involved in human language processing 
    within discourse context. To achieve this, I employ a dual approach. On the one hand, I conduct behavioral experiments 
    to explore discourse comprehension through cross-linguistic and cross-populational studies. On the other, I leverage 
    computational methods in Natural Language Processing to gain insights into human language processing, as well as 
    develop and test hypotheses about cognitive models.
