<p>
  I am a Language Scientist and Engineer bridging Linguistics, Cognitive Science, and Natural Language Processing.
</p>

<p> 
  I am currently a <a href="https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/people/profiles">Teaching Fellow at the University of Chicago</a>, 
  where I teach courses ranging from introductory Psycholinguistics and Linguistics to 
  more advanced courses such as Experimental and Computational Methods in Language Science Research. </p>

<p>
  The central questions guiding my work are: 
  (i) How do humans perceive <b>nuance and naturalness in conversations</b>, and what <b>cognitive processes</b> underlie these judgments in real time?
  (ii) How can we design <b>evaluation frameworks for conversational AI</b> so that it reflect the fine-grained human intuition on conversations?
  To address these questions, I combine NLP techniques and model analyses with linguistic theory and human behavioral experiments using reading and eye-tracking methods.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I completed my PhD in Linguistics at the University of Chicago, where I was part of 
  <a href="https://uchicagocompling.github.io">Computational Lingiustics Lab</a> and Language Processing Lab.
  I also worked with <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/" target="_blank">Ming Xiang</a> and <a href="https://aetting.github.io" target="_blank">Allyson Ettinger</a>.
