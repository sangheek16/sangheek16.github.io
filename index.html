<p>
  I am a Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow in Linguistics and the College at The University of Chicago.
</p>

<p>
  The overarching goal of my research is to understand the cognitive mechanisms involved in human language processing 
  within discourse context. To achieve this, I employ a dual approach. On the one hand, I conduct behavioral experiments 
  to explore discourse comprehension through cross-linguistic and cross-populational studies. On the other, I leverage 
  computational methods in Natural Language Processing to gain insights into human language processing, as well as 
  develop and test hypotheses about cognitive models.
