<p>
  I am a Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow in Linguistics and the College at the University of Chicago.
</p>

<p>
  The overarching goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying human language processing in discourse context.
  To do so, I take a dual approach. On the one hand, I conduct behavioral experiments to understand discourse comprehension in humans through 
  cross-linguistic and cross-populational investigations. On the other, I use computational methods in Natural Language Processing
  to gain insights about human language processing and build and test hypotheses about cognitive models.
