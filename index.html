<p>
  I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the University of Chicago.
  I'm a <a href="https://www.franke.uchicago.edu/franke-fellows" target="_blank">Franke Institute Doctoral Residential Fellow</a> in AY 2023-24.
  I will be in Paris in Spring 2024 to work with Laboratoire d’Excellence Empirical Foundations of Linguistics (Labex EFL)
  for a <a href="https://en.labex-efl.fr/axe-2" target="_blank">collaborative project on crosslinguistic exploration of relative clauses</a>
  (funded by the French government, ANR-10-LABX-0083).

  My research focuses on language processing and understanding in humans and machines especially in discourse/dialogue situations.
  The overarching goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying human sentence/discourse comprehension in conversational settings.
  To do so, I take a dual approach. On the one hand, I conduct behavioral experiments to understand discourse comprehension in humans through 
  cross-linguistic and cross-populational investigations. On the other, I use computational methods in Natural Language Processing
  to gain insights about human language processing and build and test hypotheses about cognitive models. 
  For my dissertation work, I explore the memory encoding and retrieval of discourse structure information in real-time human language comprehension 
  (supported by NSF DDRI Grant BCS-2214437). 
  I use different structures with appositive and restrictive relative clauses and utilize behavioral experiments and computational methods.
  I work closely with <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/" target="_blank">Ming Xiang</a> and <a href="https://aetting.github.io/" target="_blank">Allyson Ettinger</a>. 
</p>

<p><i>Misc</i>:
  I enjoy making pottery and participating in theatrical performances as an actor when time allows. 
  I have a long-standing interest in bridging linguistics and theatre/play acting. 
  I am eager to connect with people who have similar thoughts,
  particularly those with a background in acting in theatre and performances, or the like.
  If you share this interest, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
