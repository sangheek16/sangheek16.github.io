<p>
  I am a Language Scientist and Engineer, bridging Linguistics, Cognitive Science, and Natural Language Processing.
</p>

<p> 
  I am currently a Teaching Fellow at the University of Chicago, 
  where I teach courses ranging from introductory Psycholinguistics and Linguistics to 
  advanced methods in experimental and computational approaches to language science research. </p>

<p>
  The central questions guiding my work are: 
  <br>
  (i) How do humans comprehend nuance in dialogue and recognize when conversations go awry? What happens in the mind in real time?
  <br>
  (ii) How can we design evaluation frameworks for conversational AI so that it reflect the fine-grained human intuition on conversations?</li>
  <br>
  To address these questions, I combine NLP techniques and model analyses with linguistic theory and human behavioral experiments using reading and eye-tracking methods.
</p>

  Previously, I completed my PhD in Linguistics at the University of Chicago, where I was part of 
  <a href="https://uchicagocompling.github.io">Computational Lingiustics Lab</a> and Language Processing Lab.
  I also worked with <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/" target="_blank">Ming Xiang</a> and <a href="https://aetting.github.io" target="_blank">Allyson Ettinger</a>.
