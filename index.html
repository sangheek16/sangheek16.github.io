  I am a Language Scientist and Engineer, currently working as Teaching Fellow at the University of Chicago.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  I specialize in language understanding in humans and machines, 
  with a focus on discourse, dialogue comprehension, and conversational AI. 
  My research focuses on understanding the cognitive mechanisms that support language processing in discourse contexts and 
  developing linguistically motivated, systematic, and quantifiable methods for evaluating conversational AI systems. 
  To do this, I combine web-based behavioral, reading, and eye-tracking experiments with NLP techniques and model analysis. 
  I also teach core courses for undergraduates in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Computer Science.

<p>
  My research brings together psycholinguistics and natural language processing 
  to study language understanding in humans and machines.
  I focus on understanding discourse and dialogue comprehension, and conversational AI.
</p>

<p>
  The central question guiding my work is how cognitive mechanisms support language processing in discourse contexts, 
  and how those can inform us to develop linguistically motivated, systematic, and quantifiable methods 
  for evaluating conversational AI systems.
  To answer these, I combine web-based behavioral, reading, and eye-tracking experiments with NLP techniques and model analysis. 
</p>

<p>
  I also teach core undergraduate courses in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Computer Science. 
  I am open to collaborative work on connecting theories of human language to methods for analyzing language models.
