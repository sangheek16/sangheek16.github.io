<p>
  I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the University of Chicago. Currently I am at NYU as a visiting academic at the Center for Data Science. <br>
  I'll be a <a href="https://www.franke.uchicago.edu/franke-fellows" target="_blank">Franke Institute Doctoral Fellow</a> in AY 2023-24.
</p>

<p>
  My research focuses on language processing and understanding in humans and machines especially in discourse and dialogue situations. <br>
  I work closely with <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/" target="_blank">Ming Xiang</a> and <a href="https://aetting.github.io/" target="_blank">Allyson Ettinger</a>.

  <!-- For my dissertation work, I explore the interaction of discourse status and memory retrieval in real time language processing (supported by NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (BCS-2214437); Co-PI: Ming Xiang). I use different structures with appositive and restrictive relative clauses and utilize behavioral experiments and computational methods to answer the questions I raise. -->
  For my dissertation work, I explore the memory encoding and retrieval of discourse structure information in real-time human language comprehension (supported by NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (BCS-2214437); Co-PI: Ming Xiang). I use different structures with appositive and restrictive relative clauses and utilize behavioral experiments and computational methods.
