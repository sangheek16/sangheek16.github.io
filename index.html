<p>
  I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the University of Chicago.
  I'm a <a href="https://www.franke.uchicago.edu/franke-fellows" target="_blank">Franke Institute Doctoral Residential Fellow</a> in AY 2023-24.<br>
  My research focuses on language processing and understanding in humans and machines especially in discourse and dialogue situations.
</p>

<p>
  The overarching goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying human sentence processing and discourse comprehension.
  To do so, I take a dual approach. On the one hand, I conduct behavioral experiments to understand discourse comprehension in humans through 
  cross-linguistic and cross-populational investigations. On the other, I use computational methods in Natural Language Processing
  to gain insights about human language processing and build and test hypotheses about cognitive models. 
  I work closely with <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/" target="_blank">Ming Xiang</a> and <a href="https://aetting.github.io/" target="_blank">Allyson Ettinger</a>.

<p>
  For my dissertation work, I explore the memory encoding and retrieval of discourse structure information in real-time human language comprehension 
  (supported by NSF DDRI Grant BCS-2214437). 
  I use different structures with appositive and restrictive relative clauses and utilize behavioral experiments and computational methods.
